# Snak Game Python
Snake Game like the one on the legendary Nokia 3310

## INTRODUCTION

We have created the classic Snake Game using Python. The Snake Game was first seen on the legendary Nokia 3310 phone which was one of the first phones available to consumers at a reasonable price. Though a lot of time has passed since then, still everyone finds this game a very addictive one. We also have memories associated with this game and that’s why we discussed and decided to make this game. 

## The working of the game:

The working of the game is quite simple. We have linked the movement of the snake to the four arrow keys present on our keyboard. Food is randomly generated and we have to make our snake eat it. Whenever the snake eats food, its score is increased by 1 and so is the length of the snake. The basic purpose of the game is to score the highest possible score without hitting the walls and without colliding the head with the body.

## Here are the game Rules -

1. The game has a simple snake that can be controlled by the arrow keys of the keyboard.
2. Food is generated randomly.
3. We have to navigate the snake through arrow keys such that it eats the food so as to increase our score.
4. The snake should not touch the walls.
5. The snake should not collide with its body.
